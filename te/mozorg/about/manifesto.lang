;The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress. It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.

;Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.

;Introduction
పరిచయం


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
ఇంటర్నెట్ మన జీవితాల్లో చాలా ముఖ్యమైన భాగం అయింది.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.

;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.

;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.

;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
Mozilla మానిఫెస్టోను ముందుకు సాగించడం


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
Mozilla మానిఫెస్టో యొక్క సూత్రాలను అభివృద్ధి చేయటానికి అనేక మార్గాలు ఉన్నాయి. విస్తృత శ్రేణి కార్యకలాపాలను మేము స్వాగతిస్తున్నాము, మరియు Mozillaలో పాల్గొన్న వారి ఇతర విభాగాలలో చేసిన ప్రాజెక్టులలో చూపిన అదే సృజనాత్మకతను చూపిస్తారని ఆశిస్తాము. Mozilla ప్రాజెక్ట్ లో లోతుగా పాల్గొనని వ్యక్తులకు, మానిఫెస్టోకి మద్దతు ఇవ్వడానికి ఒక ప్రాథమిక మరియు చాలా సమర్థవంతమైన మార్గం Mozilla Firefox మరియు మానిఫెస్టో సూత్రాలతో రూపొందించే ఇతర ఉత్పత్తులను ఉపయోగించడం.

;Some Foundation activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products—are conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
కొన్ని ఫౌండేషన్ కార్యకలాపాలు—ప్రస్తుతం వినియోగదారుల ఉత్పత్తుల సృష్టి, పంపిణీ మరియు ప్రచారం—ప్రధానంగా Mozilla Foundation యొక్క పూర్తి యాజమాన్యంలోని ఉపసంస్థ Mozilla Corporation ద్వారా నిర్వహించబడుతుంది.


;Invitation
ఆహ్వానం


;The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.
Mozilla Foundation, Mozilla మానిఫెస్టో యొక్క సూత్రాలకు మద్దతు ఇచ్చే ఇతరులను మాతో చేరాలని ఆహ్వానిస్తుంది, మరియు ఇంటర్నెట్ యొక్క వాస్తవికతను ఈ దృశ్యమానంగా చేయడానికి కొత్త మార్గాలను కనుగొనండి.
