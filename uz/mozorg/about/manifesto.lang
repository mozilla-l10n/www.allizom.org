;Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways.

We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.

# Strings for mozilla.org/about/manifesto/details/
;Introduction
Ko‘rsatma


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
Internet hayotimizning eng muhim qismiga aylanib bormoqda.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Mozilla loyihasi ochiqlik, innovatsiya va imkoniyat internetning davom etadigan yaroqliligiga ishonuvchi odamlarning global jamiyati hisoblanadi. Biz 1998-yildan buyon internetni hammaga foydasi tegadigan yo‘lda rivojlantirishiini ta’minlovchi insonlar bilan birga ishlaymiz. Biz "Mozilla Firefox"ni veb brauzer qilib yaratish bilan mashhurmiz.


;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.
Mozilla loyihasi dunyo-sinfi uchun ochiq manbali dasturiy ta’minot yaratish va hamkolik faoliyatining yangi turlarini tuzish uchun jamiyatga asoslangan yondashuvdan foydalanadi. Biz internet bo‘yicha tajribalarini bizning hammamiz uchun yaxshiroq qilish uchun jalb qilingan odamlar jamiyatini yaratamiz.


;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
Ushbu harakatlar natijasida biz internetni hayotning tijoriy ko‘rinishi sifatida ommaning foydasini yaxshilashni davom etish jiddiy ekanligiga ishonadigan tamoyillar jamlanmasini distilladik. Ushbu tamoyillarimizni quyida o‘rnatganmiz.


;The goals for the Manifesto are to:
Manifest uchun yutuqlar:


;articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
Mozilla hissa qo‘shuvchilari davom ettirish uchun Mozilla Foundation’ni xohlaydigan Internet uchun tasavvurni shakllantirish.


;speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
texnik bilimlarga ega va ega bo‘lmagan odamlar bilan suhbatlashish


;make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
Mozilla hissa qo‘shuvchilarida biz qilayotgan ish bilan faxr uyg‘otish va davom ettirishimiz uchun ruhlantirish; va


;provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.
boshqa odamlar uchun internet tasavvurini kengaytirishni ta’minlash.


;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
Ushbu tamoyillar o‘z-o‘zidan hayotimizga kelib qolmagan. Odamlar internetni ochiq va hissa qo‘shish uchun kerak - odamlar alohida-alohida harakat qilishmoqda, guruhlarda ishlashmoqda va boshqalarga sardorlik qilishmoqda. Mozilla Foundation Mozilla manifesti tamoyillarini o‘rnatishni kengaytirishga mo‘ljallangan. Biz boshqalarni bizga qo‘shilishga va internetni hamma uchun har doimgidan yaxshi joy qilish uchun taklif qilamiz.


;Principles
Tamoyillar


;Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
Yakka shaxslar internetni shakllantirish va o‘zlarining tajribalarini internetda sinab ko‘rish qobiliyatiga ega bo‘lishlari kerak.


;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
Mozilla manifestini kengaytirish


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
Mozilla manifesti tamoyillarini kengaytirishning ko‘pgina turli yo‘llari mavjud. Biz faoliyatning keng oralig‘ini qo‘llab-quvvatlaymiz va Mozilla ishtirokchilarining boshqa loyihasi hududlarida xuddu shunday ijodiy kuch-quvvat ko‘rsatishnini kutamiz. Yakka shaxslar uchun Mozilla loyihasiga chuqur jalb qilinmagan. Mozilla manifestini qo‘llab-quvvatlashning bitta asosiy va juda samarali yo‘li Manifest tamoyillariga kiruvchi Mozilla Firefox va boshqa mahsulotlardan foydalanish hisoblanadi.


;Mozilla Foundation Pledge
Mozilla Foundation ahdnomasi


;The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities. Specifically, we will:

;Some Foundation activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products—are conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
Ba’zi Foundation faoliyatlari—joriy yaratish, yetkazib berish va ist’molchi mahsulotlarini qo‘llab-quvvatlash—Mozilla Foundation’ning asosiy bugun egalik qilgan filiali, Mozilla Korporatsiyasi orqali boshqariladi.


;Invitation
Taklif


;The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.
Mozilla Foundation bizga qo‘shilishi uchun va internetning ushbu ko‘rinishini amalga oshirishning yangi yo‘llarini topuvchi Mozilla manifesti tamoyillarini qo‘llab-quvvatlovchi barcha boshqalarni taklif qiladi.
