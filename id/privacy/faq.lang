Kami Berdiri Untuk Masyarakat Di Atas Laba


# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
Terkadang bisa menjadi rumit bagi orang untuk mengetahui apa yang diharapkan dari peranti lunak atau layanan yang mereka gunakan hari ini. Teknologi yang menggerakkan kehidupan kita sangat kompleks dan orang tidak memiliki waktu untuk menggalinya hingga rinci. Itu masih benar bagi Firefox, di mana kami menemukan bahwa masyarakat memiliki pemikiran yang berbeda-beda tentang apa yang terjadi di balik layar peramban mereka.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.
Kami mengikuti satu set <a href="%(link)s">Prinsip Privasi Data</a> yang membentuk pendekatan kami untuk privasi pada peramban Firefox desktop dan seluler.


;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
Kami hanya mengumpulkan data yang kami perlukan untuk membuat produk terbaik.


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
Kami memberikan masyarakat kendali atas data dan pengalaman daring mereka.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.
Kami mengikuti prinsip “tidak ada kejutan”, berarti kami bekerja keras memastikan pemahaman Firefox masyarakat tepat sesuai kenyataan.


;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
Pertanyaan dan jawaban berikut dapat membantu Anda memahami apa yang diharapkan dari Mozilla dan Firefox:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
Saya menggunakan Firefox untuk hampir semua hal di Web. Kalian di Mozilla pasti tahu banyak hal tentang saya, kan?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
Firefox, peramban web yang berjalan pada peranti atau komputer Anda adalah gerbang Anda ke internet. Peramban Anda akan mengelola banyak informasi tentang situs web yang Anda kunjungi, tapi informasi tersebut tetap berada pada peranti Anda. Mozilla, perusahaan yang membuat Firefox, tidak mengumpulkannya (kecuali Anda meminta kami melakukannya).


;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
Mozilla sungguh tidak mengumpulkan riwayat penjelajahan saya?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.
Mozilla tidak tahu seberapa besar ekspektasi Anda tentang bagaimana orang menjelajah Web. Sebagai pembuat peramban, hal tersebut adalah tantangan besar bagi kami. Itulah mengapa kami membangun alat yang dapat dipilih, seperti <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, membolehkan pengguna yang tertarik memberikan wawasan tentang penjelajahan Web-nya kepada kami. Jika Anda menyinkronkan riwayat penjelajahan sepanjang pemasangan Firefox, kami tidak tahu apa di dalamnya - karena itu dienkripsi oleh perangkat Anda.


;It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
Sepertinya setiap perusahaan di web membeli dan menjual data saya. Mozilla mungkin tidak berbeda.


;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.
Mozilla tidak menjual data tentang Anda, dan kami tidak membeli data tentang Anda.


;Wait, so how do you make money?
Jadi bagaimana Mozilla menghasilkan uang?

;Mozilla does collect a limited set of data by default from Firefox that helps us to understand how people use the browser. That data is tied to a random identifier, rather than your name or email address. You can read more about that on our <a href="%(privacy)s">privacy notice</a> and you can read the <a href="%(data)s">full documentation for that data collection</a>.

# "Gobbledygook" is a fun way to say nonsense or gibberish
;That documentation is gobbledygook to me! Can you give it to me in plain English?
Dokumentasinya terlalu rumit! Bisakah Anda menyediakannya dalam bahasa Inggris sederhana?


;There are two categories of data that we collect by default in our release version of Firefox.
Ada dua kategori data yang kami kumpulkan secara baku di dalam versi rilis Firefox kami.


;The first is what we call "technical data." This is data about the browser itself, such as the operating system it is running on and information about errors or crashes.

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

Apakah Mozilla mengumpulkan lebih banyak data di versi prarilis dari Firefox?


;Sort-of. In addition to the data described above, we receive crash and error reports by default in pre-release version of Firefox.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.
