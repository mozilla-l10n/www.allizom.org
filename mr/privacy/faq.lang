# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.
आम्ही काही <a href="%(link)s">माहिती गोपनीयता तत्वे</a> पाळतो जी आमचा Firefox डेस्कटॉप आणि मोबाईल ब्राउझर वर गोपनीयतेचा दृष्टिकोन ठरवतात.


;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
आम्ही फक्त सर्वोत्तम उत्पादने बनवण्यासाठी माहिती गोळा करतो.


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
आम्ही लोकांनाच त्यांच्या ऑनलाईन अनुभव आणि माहितीचे नियंत्रण देतो.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.

;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
Mozilla आणि Firefox कडून काय अपेक्षित आहे हे समजून घेण्यास खालील प्रश्न आणि उत्तर आपल्याला मदत करू शकतील:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?

;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).

;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
खरंच, आपण माझा ब्राऊझिंग इतिहास जमा करत नाही?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.

;It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
वेब वरची प्रत्येक कंपनी माझी माहिती खरेदी किंवा विक्री करत आहे असे वाटते. तुम्ही बहुधा वेगळे नाही.


;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.
Mozilla आपल्याबद्दल माहिती विकत किंवा खरेदी करत नाही.


;Wait, so how do you make money?
थांबा, तर मग आपण पैसे कसे कमवता?

;Okay, those first few were softballs. What data do you collect?
ठीक आहे, पहिले काही सोपे होते. आपण कोणती माहिती गोळा करता?

;Mozilla does collect a limited set of data by default from Firefox that helps us to understand how people use the browser. That data is tied to a random identifier, rather than your name or email address. You can read more about that on our <a href="%(privacy)s">privacy notice</a> and you can read the <a href="%(data)s">full documentation for that data collection</a>.

# "Gobbledygook" is a fun way to say nonsense or gibberish
;That documentation is gobbledygook to me! Can you give it to me in plain English?
तो दस्तऐवज मला गोंधळवून टाकतो! मला सध्या भाषेत सांगाल का?


;There are two categories of data that we collect by default in our release version of Firefox.
मुळतः Firefox च्या प्रकाशन आवृत्ती मध्ये आम्ही दोन प्रकारची माहिती गोळा करतो.


;The first is what we call "technical data." This is data about the browser itself, such as the operating system it is running on and information about errors or crashes.

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;Do you collect more data in pre-release versions of Firefox?
आपण FIrefox च्या प्रकाशनपूर्व आवृत्ती मध्ये जास्त माहिती गोळा करता का?


;Sort-of. In addition to the data described above, we receive crash and error reports by default in pre-release version of Firefox.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.

;But why do you collect any data at all?
पण मुळात आपण माहिती गोळाच का करता?


;If we don’t know how the browser is performing or which features people use, we can’t make it better and deliver the great product you want. We’ve invested in building data collection and analysis tools that allow us to make smart decisions about our product while respecting people's privacy.

;Data collection still bugs me. Can I turn it off?
माहिती गोळा करणे मला खटकते. मी ते बंद करू शकतो का?

;What about my account data?
माझ्या खात्याच्या माहितीचे काय?


;We are big believers of data minimization and not asking for things we don't need.
आम्ही गरज नसलेली माहिती गोळा न करणे आणि माहिती कमी करण्यामध्ये विश्वास ठेवतो.


;You don't need an account to use Firefox. <a href="%(accounts)s">Accounts</a> are required to sync data across devices, but we only ask you for an email address. We don't want to know things like your name, address, birthday and phone number.

नाही, आम्ही उद्देशीय जाहिराती बनवण्यासाठी लोकांची माहिती खरेदी करत नाही.


;We do ask our advertising partners to use only first party data that websites and publishers know about all users, such as the browser you are using and the device you are on.

;Well, it seems like you really have my back on this privacy stuff.
आपण खरोखरच ह्या गोपनीयतेच्या बाबतीत खंबीर आहात असे दिसते.


;Yes, we do.
हो, आम्ही करतो.
