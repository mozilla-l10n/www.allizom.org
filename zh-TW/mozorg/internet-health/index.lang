;Choice is a good thing
有所選擇是一件好事


;Name 5 websites you visit daily. Now 10, 20 or even 30. Tricky, right? When a few big companies “own” the Internet, choice can be limited, but you don’t have to be.

網路上的隱私


;Internet’s got trust issues
Internet 真的有些信任問題


;Privacy shouldn’t be a privilege. In fact, the Internet only stays healthy if we trust it as a safe place – to explore, transact, connect and create.
隱私不該是種特權。事實上，只有在我們還信任 Internet 是個安全的地方的時候，才有健康的生態能進行探索、交易、連結他人，或創造新事物。
