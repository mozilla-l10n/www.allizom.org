;Why we need donations
我們為什麼需要捐款


;You might already know that Thunderbird improvements are no longer paid for by Mozilla. Fortunately there is an active community keeping it running and developing it further. But to survive long term, the project needs funding.
您可能已知道 Mozilla 已經不再資助 Thunderbird 的開發，但幸運的是，有個活躍的社群願意接手處理，繼續開發 Thunderbird。但若要能夠長期經營下去，整個專案仍然需要有穩定的收入來源。


;Thunderbird is currently transitioning to an independent organization. Being independent, we can shape our own fate, but there is significant infrastructure that must be maintained to deliver the application to our tens of millions of users. For Thunderbird to survive and continue to evolve, we need your support and ask for your donation today. All the money donated will go directly to funding Thunderbird development and infrastructure.
