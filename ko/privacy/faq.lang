;Mozilla’s Data Privacy FAQ
Mozilla의 데이터 개인정보 보호 FAQ


# HTML page description
;At Mozilla we respect and protect your personal information.
Mozilla는 여러분의 개인정보를 존중하고 보호합니다.


;We Stand for People Over Profit.
우리는 이익보다 사람을 위합니다.


# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
요즘 사람들이 사용하는 소프트웨어나 서비스로부터 무엇을 기대해야하는지 아는 것은 까다로울 수 있습니다. 우리의 삶에 힘을 불어넣어주는 기술들은 복잡하며 사람들은 자세한 내용을 파고들기 위한 시간이 없습니다. 그것은 Firefox 또한 마찬가지이며, 우리는 사람들이 그들의 브라우저 안에서 어떤 일이 벌어지고 있는지 많은 다른 생각들을 가지고 있다는 것을 압니다.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.
우리는 <a href="%(link)s">데이터 개인정보 원칙들</a>을 따르며 이는 Firefox 데스크탑과 모바일 브라우저에서 개인정보에 접근하는 우리의 방식을 결정합니다.


;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
우리는 오직 최고의 제품을 만드는데 필요한 데이터만 수집합니다.


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
우리는 사람들이 자신의 데이터와 온라인 경험을 직접 결정하도록 합니다.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.
우리는 “놀래키지 않기” 원칙을 준수하며, 이는 사람들의 Firefox에 대한 이해와 현실이 일치하도록 우리가 노력한다는 것을 의미합니다.


;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
다음 질문들과 대답들은 여러분이 Mozilla와 Firefox로부터 어떤 것을 기대할지 이해하는데 도움이 될 것입니다:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
저는 웹에서 거의 모든 것을 위해 FireFox를 사용합니다. Mozilla 여러분들은 저에 대해 수많은 것을 아시겠어요, 맞나요?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
여러분의 기기 혹은 컴퓨터에서 실행되는 웹 브라우저인 Firefox는 인터넷으로 통하는 여러분의 관문입니다. 여러분의 브라우저는 여러분이 방문하는 웹사이트들에 대한 많은 정보를 관리하지만, 그 정보는 여러분의 기기에 남아있습니다. Firefox를 만드는 회사인 Mozilla는 그것들을 수집하지 않습니다(여러분이 저희에게 요청하지 않는 한).


;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
정말로, 여러분은 제 탐색 기록을 수집하지 않나요?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.
Mozilla는 사람들이 웹을 어떻게 탐색하는지 여러분이 생각하는 것만큼 많이 알지 못합니다. 브라우저 제작자로서 이것은 사실 우리에게 큰 도전입니다. 이것이 우리가 <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>같은 내장 도구들을 만들어 관심있는 사용자들이 그들의 웹 탐색에 대해 우리에게 인사이트를 제공할 수 있도록 하는 이유입니다. 만약 여러분이 여러 Firefox에 걸쳐 탐색 히스토리를 동기화하더라도 우리는 그 히스토리가 무엇인지 알지 못합니다 - 여러분의 기기에서 암호화되기 때문입니다.


;It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
웹 상의 모든 회사들은 내 정보를 사고 파는 것 같습니다. 아마 여러분도 다르지 않겠죠.


;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.
Mozilla는 여러분에 대한 정보를 팔지 않고, 여러분에 대한 정보를 사지도 않습니다.


;Wait, so how do you make money?
잠깐, 그러면 여러분은 어떻게 돈을 버나요?

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.
