;The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress. It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.

;Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.

;Introduction
Šintin daara


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
Interneti dogoo mma beeri ka tonton waati kul hõ borey hunaroo ra.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Mozilla porožewoo ti adduɲɲaa-mee jamaa kaŋ borey ga tammahã kaŋ interneti baanoo ši duumi kala nd'a ga feera, a ga tejandi nd'a ga nafa. Za 1998 ir ga durkutu ka cimandi kaŋ interneti ga cina nda taka kaŋ ga borey kul nafa. Ir maaɲey fatta nda Mozilla Firefox ceecikaa.


;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.
Mozilla porožewoo ti jama-gorante goymee kaŋ ga goyijinay aššil feerante šifante tee nda fondo taagayaŋ feeri kaŋ ra borey ga goy nda cere. Ir jamaayaŋ marga kaŋ kanbuzaama ti interneti goyyan ma boori ka tonton ir kul se.


;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
Woodin ra, ir na fondayaŋ kayandi kaŋ ir ga tammahã i ga tabatandi kaŋ interneti ma gaabandi ka tee baytal ka borey nafa nda duura faalandi i se. Ir ga fondawey wey filla ne ganda.


;The goals for the Manifesto are to:
Bayrandiyanoo anniyawey ti:


;articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
ka interneti honnandi kaŋ Mozilla cereteekey ga boona Mozilla sinjiyan kondaa ga durkutu ka too r'a;


;speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
ka šelaŋ borey se wal'i goo nda ordinater waanay wal'i ši nd'a;


;make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
ka too Mozilla kanbuzaakey ma ɲaali nda woo kaŋ ir g'a tee nda ka duu bine ka gaabandi; nda


;provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.
ka fondo feeri borey jerey se hala lakkaloo woo ma interneti ka koy nda jine.


;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
Fondawey wey ši kaa ka feera ngi boŋ se. Ir ga borey kaŋ ga goy k'internetoo feeri margayan goy se - boro fooyaŋ, borey kaŋ ga tee kondayyaŋ wala wakkiiliyaŋ jerey se. Mozilla sinjiyanoo huzunoo ti fondawey kaŋ harandi Mozilla bayrandoo ra ma diyandi. Ir boro tanayaŋ da cee i m'ir gana ka interneti tee nungu boryo ka tonton boro kul se.


;Principles
Fondawey


;Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
Boro foo kul ma hin ka interneti fasal nga boŋ hunaroo nda alfaydaa se.


;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
Hala Mozilla bayrandoo ma koy nda jine


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
Taka booboyaŋ goo no kaŋ nda Mozilla bayrandoo fondawey ga hin ka koy jine. Ir ga boona goy dumiyan kaŋ ga waani, ir ga naata laasaabay henna follokaa ga kaŋ Mozilla kanbedamkey n'a cebe porožewoo mise fooyaŋ ra.

;The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities. Specifically, we will:
