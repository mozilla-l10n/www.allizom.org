# Used as HTML description of the page
;A decentralized internet, owned by all of us, is where net neutrality, interoperability, competition, and local contribution thrive.
Eit desentralisert internett, som er eigd av oss alle, er der nettnøytralitet, interoperabilitet, konkurranse og lokale bidrag trivst.

;A healthy Internet is created and owned by us all
Eit sunt internett vert skapt og eigd av oss alle


;The Internet owes much of its success to openness: its open, shared structure has made it easy for everyone to build, surf, and thrive on it. But a few big companies are closing in, closing doors, and creating walled gardens that concentrate their ownership and control of the Web. Together, we can fight to make sure no one limits our Internet access, experience, or creation.

;Decentralization means Net Neutrality
Desentralisering betyr nettnøytralitet


;No one should be able to restrict our access to the Web for their own gain.
Ingen bør kunna avgrense tilgangen vår til nettet for eiga vinning.


;We rely on network providers – telcos and cable companies – for access to the Internet. Which puts them in a position to restrict that access for their own business objectives, favoring their own products, blocking sites or brands, or charging different prices and offering different speeds depending on content type. Net neutrality prohibits network providers from discriminating based on content, so everyone has equal access.

;Interoperability is a big word with a simple result: your Web experience is basically the same across browsers, hardware, and operating systems because it was designed that way – and built with the open standards to support it. Open standards also allow anyone to invent new ways to make your Web experience better. But interoperability is losing ground to closed systems – and we’re losing transparency, participation, and innovation along with it.

;A personalized Internet is an exciting prospect. But more and more, that means opting into a single company’s ecosystem – which streamlines your experience right now, but may seriously limit your choices in the future. Competitors will be reduced to those few companies who can offer the whole enchilada, thus consolidating the power of existing tech giants and making it much harder for entrepreneurs to disrupt the market with great ideas.
