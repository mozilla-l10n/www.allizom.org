;The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress.

;Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways.

;Introduction
Intshayelelo


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
I-intanethi iya isiba yinxalenye ebalulekileyo yobomi bethu.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Iprojekthi yakwaMozilla luluntu olusemhlabeni wonke abakholelwa kwelokuba ukungafihli nto, ukuqulunqa iindlela ezintsha, namathuba angundoqo kwinkqubela phambili yeIntanethi. Besisebenza kunye ukususela ngowe-1998 ekuqinisekiseni ukuba i-Intanethi iphuhliswa ngendlela yokuba kuxhamle wonke umntu. Saziwa ngcono ngokudala ibhrawuza yewebhu iMozilla Firefox.


;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.
Iprojekthi yeMozilla isebenzisa indlela yoluntu ekudaleni isoftwe ekudidi lwehlabathi evulekileyo nokuphuhlisa iintlobo ezintsha zemisebenzi yokubambisana. Sidala uluntu oluzibandakanya nokwenza amava e-Intanethi abe ngcono kuthi sonke.


;As a result of these efforts, we have distilled a set of principles that we believe are critical for the Internet to continue to benefit the public good as well as commercial aspects of life. We set out these principles below.
Ngenxa yezi nzame, siye sabethelela imigaqo ethile esikholelwa ukuba ibalulekile ukuze i-Intanethi iqhubeke iyinzuzo eluntwini nakwezorhwebo. Sibeke le migaqo ingezantsi.


;The goals for the Manifesto are to:
Iinjono zoXwebhu:


;articulate a vision for the Internet that Mozilla participants want the Mozilla Foundation to pursue;
chaza umbono abanawo abathathi-nxaxheba beMozilla nge-Intanethi abafuna uMbutho weMozilla iwuphumeze;


;speak to people whether or not they have a technical background;
sithethe nabantu nokuba banalo okanye abanalo ufifi ngezobugcisa;


;make Mozilla contributors proud of what we're doing and motivate us to continue; and
senza abo banegalelo kwiMozilla bazidle ngoko sikwenzayo baze basikhuthaze ukuba siqhubeke; kunye


;provide a framework for other people to advance this vision of the Internet.
sinika abantu inkqubo yokuba baqhubele phambili nalo mbono weIntanethi.


;These principles will not come to life on their own. People are needed to make the Internet open and participatory - people acting as individuals, working together in groups, and leading others. The Mozilla Foundation is committed to advancing the principles set out in the Mozilla Manifesto. We invite others to join us and make the Internet an ever better place for everyone.
Le migaqo ayisoze iziqhube ngokwayo. Kufuneka abantu ukwenza i-Intanethi ivulekele wonke umntu yaye wonke ubani abe nenxaxheba kuyo - abantu ngabanye, abo basebenza kunye njengamaqela, kwanabo bakhokela abanye. UMbutho weMozilla uzibophelele ekuqhubeleni phambili imigaqo echazwe kuXwebhu lwakwaMozilla. Simema abanye ukuba bazimanye nathi ekwenzeni i-Intanethi ibe ngcono ngakumbi kumntu wonke.


;Principles
Imigaqo


;Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.
Abantu kufuneka babe nobugcisa bokumisela i-intanethi kwanamava abo kwi-intanethi.


;Advancing the Mozilla Manifesto
Ukuqhubela phambili uXwebhu lweMozilla


;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
Kukho iindlela ezininzi ezahlukeneyo zokuqhubela phambili imigaqo yoXwebhu lweMozilla. Siyayamkela imisebenzi eyahlukeneyo, yaye silindele ubuchule obufana nobo bubonakaliswe ngabathathi-nxaxheba bakwaMozilla kwezinye iinkalo zeprojekthi. Kubantu abangabandakanyekanga kakhulu kwiprojekthi yeMozilla, indlela ephambili neyimpumelelo yokuxhasa uXwebhu kukusebenzisa iMozilla Firefox equluthe imigaqo yolu Xwebhu.


;Mozilla Foundation Pledge
Nesifundo soMbutho weMozilla


;The Mozilla Foundation pledges to support the Mozilla Manifesto in its activities. Specifically, we will:
UMbutho weMozilla ufungile ukuba uza kuxhasa uXwebhu lweMozilla kwimisebenzi yawo. Ingakumbi, siza:


;build and enable open-source technologies and communities that support the Manifesto’s principles;
sakha yaye sivulela ubugcisa obuvulekileyo nobokuncokola obuxhasa imigaqo yoXwebhu;


;build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto’s principles;
sakha yaye sihambisa iimveliso ezisemagqabini zabathengi abaxhasa imigaqo yoXwebhu;


;use the Mozilla assets (intellectual property such as copyrights and trademarks, infrastructure, funds, and reputation) to keep the Internet an open platform;
kusebenzisa izinto zeMozilla (izinto ezifana namalungelo ekopi neempawu zorhwebo, iziseko zophuhliso, iimali, negama lethu) ukugcina i-Intanethi iliqonga elivulekileyo;


;promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit; and
ukukhuthaza iindella zokudala ixabiso loqoqosho ukuze kuzuze uluntu; kunye


;promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Internet industry.

;Some Foundation activities—currently the creation, delivery and promotion of consumer products—are conducted primarily through the Mozilla Foundation’s wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation.
Eminye yemisebenzi yoMbutho—sithethanje ekukudala, ukuhambisa nokukhuthaza iimveliso zabathengi—yenziwa ngokuyintloko ngoMbutho weMozilla ephantsi kweMozilla Corporation.


;Invitation
Kukumema


;The Mozilla Foundation invites all others who support the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto to join with us, and to find new ways to make this vision of the Internet a reality.
UMbutho weMozilla umele bonke abanye abantu abaxhasa imigaqo yoXwebhu lweMozilla ukuba bazimanye nathi, baze bafumane iindlela ezintsha zokwenza umbono we-Intanethi ube yimpumelelo.
